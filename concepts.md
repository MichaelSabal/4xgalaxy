###Basic concepts in 4xGalaxy

Gameplay is divided into chapters, with each chapter having a different final objective.

**Chapter 1**
You are on your planet, with a fairly robust population.  Your technology level would be considered
early industrial.  The planet may consist of one or more nations, each vying for resources.  To move 
from chapter 1 to chapter 2, you must develop spaceflight and colonization technologies, to be able
to explore the remainder of your own star system.  However, there will be many obstacles to overcome
before you can take that one giant leap.

**Chapter 2**
Take advantage of all the new resources available within your own star system, as you mine and
terraform the other planets nearby.  Establish colonies, improve your scanning capabilities,
and progress towards interstellar flight.  But don't forget to take care of your people at home,
or you may find yourself fighting an uprising.

**Chapter 3**
Expand your empire as you venture out into deep space.  Meet other races, share technologies, 
share recipes, build trade relationships and build alliances.  Beware of the many dangers nature
itself will throw at you, driving you back to your own star.  Try not to get into too many conflicts,
because an even greater danger awaits.

**Chapter 4**
All players must work together to defeat the galactic AI network, which seeks to dominate every
star and every planet for itself.  They already work together as one, and there isn't enough room
in the galaxy for both biological and computational empires.

A well balanced society must pay attention to all the needs of its citizens.  If your homeworld
or colonies don't have enough resources to meet those needs, your population may decrease, causing
delays in production of other resources.  Or you may find yourself fighting against your own
citizens, as civil wars break out, inhibiting your progress, or making it easier for external
threats to take control of your empire.  Resources are divided into the following types:
- *Raw materials* can only be used in the production of other resources,
- *Health resources* include food, water, barns, preservation, and anything else related 
to the general nutrition of the citizens,
- *Construction resources* provide shelter, factories, research centers, tools, machinery,
and general employment for many citizens,
- *Entertainment resources* are needed to keep citizens happy and productive,
- *Technology resources* drive research, making it possible to drive progress in your society,
- *Education resources* are also needed to drive research,
- *Transportation resources* allow citizens and resources to travel from one place to another
more efficiently, including among the stars,
- *Cultural resources* may offer peace among your citizens, and an attraction to other races,
- *Medical resources* will be needed to drive off disaster, as new diseases evolve to decimate
your population, or civil unrest creates unhealthy living conditions.

Similarly, technology can be divided into types:
- *Food production*
- *Food storage*
- *Mining*
- *Architecture*
- *Shielding*
- *Weapons*
- *Ships*
- *Communications*
- *Optics*
- *Education*
- *Automation*

As the game develops, additional resource and technology types will be added.
